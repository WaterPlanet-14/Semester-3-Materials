    <p>Many people believe that Leonardo Di Caprio deserved the Oscar
        more for Shutter Island and The Wolf of Wall Street instead of his win
        for the Revenant. Irrespective of this sentiment, he is indeed one of
        the best actors of this generation. His movies with Martin Scorsese
        are a treat to watch.</p>
